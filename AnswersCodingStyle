Checkstyle
    1. I put checkstyle under a reporting tab and then used mvn site to generate the report
       as an html file.
    2. Maven puts the classes under the site directory in the target folder.
    3. There were a total of 151 errors found.
    4. In the card class line 25, the error is "Line is longer than 80 characters". This
       means that sun suggests a line length of no greater than 80 characters for readable code
    5. In order to do this you would need to use custom checkstyle property expansion definitions and
       go into the checkstyle xml file and create a child property element of the module.

Findbugs
    1. Same as checkstyle i put the plugin xml under the reporting tab and then used mvn site to
       generate the report.
    2. Maven puts the report under the site folder in the target directory.
    3. There were 5 bugs 0 errors.
    4. The error in the card class says that it defines equals and uses Object.hashcode().
       This is saying it is not overriding hashcode and it is likely to violate the invarient that
       equals objects must have equal hashcodes.

PMD
    1. Same as checkstyle and findbugs i put the plugin xml under the reporting tab and then used mvn site
     to generate the report.
    2. Maven puts the report files under the site folder in the target directory.
    3. There were two violations found.
    4. Yes it is the same error that findbugs found.
    5.I would not have noticed that error looking at the code.
